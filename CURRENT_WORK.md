## 📝 How This Works

This file is a **real-time work log** that gets updated continuously during a session:

1. **Before starting any task:** Update "In Progress" section
2. **After completing any task:** Move to "Completed Today" section
3. **Every 15-30 minutes:** Commit this file
4. **At end of session:** Move everything to SESSION_HANDOFF.md and clear this file

## ⚠️ If You See Content Here

**It means the previous session was interrupted!**

**Do NOT start from scratch. Instead:**
1. Read "In Progress" section - this is where you left off
2. Read "Completed Today" - do NOT repeat these tasks
3. Continue from "Next Step"

## 🎯 Current Status

**🟢 ACTIVE SESSION** - Authentication System Implementation

**Started:** 2025-10-31
**Current Task:** Building complete Authentication System (Backend + Frontend)
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

---

## 📋 In Progress

### 🔐 Authentication System (STARTED)

**Why:** Core requirement, needed before Smart Wizard Builder

**Backend Tasks:**
- [ ] User registration endpoint (email/password validation)
- [ ] Login endpoint (JWT access + refresh tokens)
- [ ] Auth middleware and guards (role-based)
- [ ] Password reset flow (email verification)
- [ ] Email verification system

**Frontend Tasks:**
- [ ] Auth context/provider (session management)
- [ ] Register page with form validation
- [ ] Login page with error handling
- [ ] Protected routes middleware
- [ ] Session persistence (localStorage + cookies)

**Testing:**
- [ ] Unit tests for auth service
- [ ] Integration tests for auth flow
- [ ] E2E tests for register/login

**Current Step:** Planning architecture and data flow

## ✅ Completed Today

*Nothing yet - just started!*

## 🧠 Decisions Made

1. **JWT Strategy:**
   - Access token: 15 minutes (short-lived)
   - Refresh token: 7 days (stored in httpOnly cookie)
   - Token rotation on refresh

2. **Password Security:**
   - bcrypt hashing (10 rounds)
   - Min 8 characters requirement
   - Password strength validation

3. **Email Verification:**
   - Will use MailHog for development (already running)
   - Verification token expires in 24 hours
