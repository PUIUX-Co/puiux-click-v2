## 📝 How This Works

This file is a **real-time work log** that gets updated continuously during a session:

1. **Before starting any task:** Update "In Progress" section
2. **After completing any task:** Move to "Completed Today" section
3. **Every 15-30 minutes:** Commit this file
4. **At end of session:** Move everything to SESSION_HANDOFF.md and clear this file

## ⚠️ If You See Content Here

**It means the previous session was interrupted!**

**Do NOT start from scratch. Instead:**
1. Read "In Progress" section - this is where you left off
2. Read "Completed Today" - do NOT repeat these tasks
3. Continue from "Next Step"
